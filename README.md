# so_long_42_project_07
First graphical project of 42 common core.

The So_long project at École 42 is a 2D game that involves creating an interactive environment where a character collects objects while avoiding obstacles.
The player controls the character through a maze generated from a map.

The main objective of the project is to develop a minimalist game engine using the C language and the miniLibX graphics library.
Students are required to implement key functionalities necessary for the game, such as graphics rendering, keyboard event handling,
collision detection between the character and objects/obstacles, as well as score and movement management.

The project starts with reading a map file that defines the layout of the maze and the positions of objects and obstacles.
Students then need to graphically display the maze using textures for different elements of the game, such as the character,
walls, collectible objects, and more.

The player can interact with the character using keyboard keys to navigate through the maze.
Students must handle keyboard events and update the character's position while avoiding collisions with walls and obstacles.
The goal is to collect all the objects on the map and exit the maze.

In summary, the So_long project at École 42 is a 2D game where students create a minimalist game engine using the C language.
They need to implement the necessary functionalities to display the maze, manage character movement, handle collisions,
and interact with objects. This project allows students to explore graphics programming, event handling,
and game logic to create an interactive gaming experience.
